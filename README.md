# Nand2Tetris
Projects created for the Hebrew University of Jerusalem course "Nand2Tetris"

Project 1: Elementary Logic Gates
    Build a basic chip-set. The only building blocks that you can use in this project are primitive Nand gates and the composite gates that you will gradually build on top of them.
